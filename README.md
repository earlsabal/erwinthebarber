[Erwin the Barber Website](https://erwinthebarber.herokuapp.com/)

### Technologies used

This website is built with Ruby on Rails implementing the MVC structure.  Views are html.erb files styled with CSS along with a few JavaScript/jQuery features

### Future goals

I plan to connect this application to Amazon Web Services so that Admins of this website can upload pictures on the website instead of using image urls to display pictures
